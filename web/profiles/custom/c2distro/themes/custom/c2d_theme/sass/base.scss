 * Base
 *
 * Base styles are the default styles of base elements. It's a combination of
 * ITCSS's Generic and Elements layers.
 *
 * A Base rule is applied to an element using an element selector, a descendant
 * selector, or a child selector, along with any pseudo-classes. It doesnâ€™t
 * include any class or ID selectors. Base styles are related to the basic
 * styles of an application, like Typography, Reset and styling of global
 * elements.
 *
 * This is the first layer which generates actual CSS.
